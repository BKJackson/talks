# Creating Reproducible Data Science Workflows using Docker Containers

## Audience Level

Intermediate

## Brief Description

Jupyter notebooks make it easy to create reproducible work that can be shared across groups and organizations. This is a simple process provided the person at the other end has a compatible Python environment, but this is usually not the case. Learn how to use Docker to create a shareable containerized environment which can be used to reproduce our work.

## Detailed Abstract

Container technologies like Docker make it easy to run software when we move from one computing environment to another. In a field such as Data Science where it is common practice to share results, containers are a useful tool we can use to package the libraries and code that others require to reproduce our work.

This talk will briefly cover the basics of Docker, discuss how containers can be used in Data Science, and provide a quick-start guide that can be used as a template to create our own shareable Docker container.

We will learn enough to start leveraging the power of Docker without having to worry about the details underlying the technology.

## Additional Notes
[Github of my talks](https://github.com/alysivji/talks). Alright, you got me. Just talk. Only 1 so far, but that is changing! I jumped into Python in December and am giving it everything I have. Love the community which has changed my life and empowered me as an individual. I want to give back and help other people out.

I've spoken at a healthcare technology meetup on the topic of how the Hadoop ecosystem can be used to drive innovation in Healthcare Analytics.

I have proven ability to explain relatively complex topics in an easy to understand manner.

workflow
download code and data into folder
then download dockerfile file
and then copy it in or set up a volume
give the option...
