## Talk Title

The Art of Developer Testing

## Length

30

## Audience

Intermediate

## Elevator Pitch

Tests ensure our program works correctly and that changes to our codebase do not break existing functionality. This talk will demystify the Art of (Developer) Testing with a focus on best practices and tools that can be used to help you write effective tests more efficiently.

## Longer Description

Seasoned developers have experience balancing writing code to solve business problems versus writing tests to ensure correctness and prevent regression. Finding this balance and knowing what to test can feel more like an art than a science, especially to those new to the industry.

This talk will introduce testing concepts and show how to apply them in an example Flask application. Topics include:

* Blackbox vs Whitebox testing
* Automated vs Manual testing
* Testing Pyramid (unit, integration, functional tests)
* Test coverage
* Introduction to pytest
* High-level overview of other testing tools
